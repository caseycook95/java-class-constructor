# java-class-constructor
The Truck class shows concepts of getters and setters for private variables, demonstrates the toString method, and demonstrates how constructors can be used to set instance variables. This Truck class also shows how different classes can be used for one program. TruckTester uses a Truck object to retrieve data that is stored in Truck.
The two classes for this program show how main methods can be made simple by storing and manipulating data in a completely different class than the class with the main method. This allows for objects of a class to be made and are used in the main method. The data can be accessed using these objects in the main method.
When programs have separate classes from the main program the variables in these separate classes use private variables so only that class can access the variable. So getters are used so the variable can be accessed from other classes with a class object. Setters are used so variables can be set using the class object in other classes.
Constructors are an easy way to automatically set variables data when making an object. In the TruckTester class this is done when a Truck object is made and the variables are set for the object when the information is put in the parenthesis of the Tuck object instance.
The toString method compiles all the variables in the Truck class together in one string that can be printed out onto the console. The method is called with the class object.
